 Game
The game i created was a basic arcade game with simply controls that does not require any instruction.
I chose simplicity as my main goal as it is the easiest to perfect. The game features a rotating turret
fires at incoming monsters approaching the other end of the screen controlled by the 'A' and 'D' keys. If the monster is hit it dissapears and 
the players score increases. When a monster hits the other end of the screen the player dies and the game is over. 
There is a variable that stores the players highscore which is changed each time a player beats it. When you open the game you are
presented with a main menu with 3 options. Start, Exit and Leader Boards. Each is clickable and goes directly to the options chosen.
